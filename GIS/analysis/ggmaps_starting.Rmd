# Getting Started with ggmap

Current Version of ggmap in R

```{r}
packageVersion("ggmap")
```
```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("stadiamaps/ggmap")
```
```{r}
install.packages("ggmap")
```
```{r}
library(ggmap)
```

Set up API key authentication¶

You'll need a Stadia Maps API key to access the tiles in ggmap.

Sign in to the client dashboard. (If you don't have an account yet, sign up for free; no credit card required!)
Click "Manage Properties."
If you have more than one property (ex: for several websites or apps), make sure you have selected the correct property from the dropdown at the top of the page.
Under "Authentication Configuration," you can generate, view or revoke your API key.

Before you draw any plots, you need to register your API key.

```{r}

register_stadiamaps("your-code-here", write = TRUE)
```

Getting a basemap for your plots¶
You can now use any of the plotting functions available in ggmap! The get_stadiamap is probably the simplest way to get a basemap image. Note that the maptype parameter for Stamen styles match our style names and include a stamen_ prefix. Here is a minimal example that shows a map of Tallinn, Estonia using get_stadiamap.

```{r}
bbox <- c(left = 24.61, bottom = 59.37, right = 24.94, top = 59.5)
get_stadiamap(bbox, zoom = 12, maptype = "stamen_toner_lite") %>% ggmap()
```

To actually do something interesting with your data though, you'll want something like qmplot. This function works just like qplot, but adds a map in the background automatically! qmplot will automatically compute a bounding box around your data, so if you already have a dataframe, you're just a few lines away from a map.

In the following example, we've extracted a set of cafes from OpenStreetMap and put them in a dataframe. All we care about for this quick visualization is the coordinates.
```{r}
df = data.frame(
  lon = c(24.7408933, 24.7456935, 24.745414, 24.7455573, 24.74466, 24.7420517, 24.7406695, 24.7503795, 24.7451665, 24.7480215, 24.7465048, 24.7476525, 24.7461528, 24.745517, 24.7470942, 24.7456197, 24.7468268, 24.7433477, 24.7439016, 24.7456759, 24.7454717, 24.7492029, 24.7538602, 24.7421455, 24.7442811, 24.7499494, 24.7541156, 24.7496663, 24.7407915, 24.749436, 24.7496639, 24.7473202, 24.7500224, 24.7459907, 24.7435694, 24.737213, 24.7411354, 24.7457404, 24.744481, 24.7461543, 24.7498606, 24.7424696, 24.7478131, 24.7427942, 24.7414089, 24.7495252, 24.749662, 24.7457476, 24.7493961, 24.7483363, 24.7508932, 24.7456813, 24.7514706, 24.7467884, 24.7500806, 24.7381424, 24.7385634, 24.7482397, 24.7487323, 24.7515429, 24.7446615, 24.748973, 24.7485532, 24.7468977, 24.7454333, 24.7384107, 24.7487002, 24.7535016, 24.7389838, 24.7453955, 24.7448729, 24.7380715, 24.7503209),
